            Henry at age 4 was motivated to create msuic as 
            he watched his older sister play a Chopanâ€™s 
            Nocturne Op. 48 No. 2. He loved the expression
            of violin and power of piano. Henry is currently
            consuming all things associated with Russian
            folk music.
